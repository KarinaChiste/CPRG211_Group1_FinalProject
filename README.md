Project Description:

For the final project, we decided to make a restaurant management system named Ascent. Ascent was designed for restaurant managers and owners to have one place where they could view all of their reservations, employees and menu items. 
Our app allows for users to easily add, view and delete menu items, reservations, and employees by using a simplistic and streamlined user interface. 
In addition to this, Ascent connects to a database so the information gathered and displayed within the app can be used elsewhere as needed.

Contribution List:

Karina:
Employees - adding, removing confirmation message, UI,
Connecting to database (database accessors)
General Debugging

Jasprit:
Made UI across all pages of app consistent/standardized
Made Menu - MenuItem.cs, MenuManager.cs, Item Type classes / UI and logic for Menu.razor, AddItem.razor, ensured that all Menu functions worked and connected to MenuDbAccessor.cs
Implemented exceptions for input validation and confirmation popup for Delete button in Menu
Assisted with debugging/logic in Reservations and Employees tabs

Ashton:
Reservations - including reservations class, ReservationManager, Reservation and AddReservation Razors.
Initial Reservation UI (Later Updated)
Small general debugging

Caden:
Orders *
Employees (edit)*

*These were later removed as they were not fully developed*


Using the Application:
 
In order for the application to work, you need to have a database named “restaurant”. 
The username should be “root” and the password is “password”. If anything isn’t working, we followed the MariaDB instructions in the content section of D2L.
